**PYTHON AND R PROJECT**
By Roberto Colangelo - Davide Rosatelli - Lisa Aita - Marco Cret√≠

In the first part of the project, we collectied data from an API and consequently created an Anime CSV.
The file Dataset_creation.ipynb is the python notebook in which we perform task1.
The same code is also uploaded in .py to avoid the visualization with all the output printed.
The description of the work done in task1 can be found in Documentation python - Anime dataset creation.docx.
The output of our work is an anime project.csv.

In the second part of the project, we analysed the dataset that we created in python, and you can find the code with an explanation in Task2 in python - Analysis on anime dataset.
Then we worked on the file covid.csv in R, and you can find code with explanation in Task 2 in R - Covid-19 analysis.pdf performed through R markdown.
