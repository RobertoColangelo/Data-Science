**PYTHON AND R PROJECT**
By Roberto Colangelo - Davide Rosatelli - Lisa Aita - Marco Cret√≠

We created 3 folders in order to organize all the files and the attachments needed to run the code properly. In the folder Python_1st_part it is possible to find the files related to the first task, while in the other two folders, R_covid and Python_2nd_part, the second part of the project. In the R_covid folder it is possible to find the files ( in .R format or as a Markdown) related to the visualization and manipulation task we were requested to perform on some other group's dataset while in the Python_2nd_part folder all the files (in .py format or .ipynb) can be found.
In the first part of the project, we collected data from an API and consequently created an Anime CSV.
The file Dataset_creation.ipynb is the python notebook in which we perform task1.
The same code is also uploaded in .py to avoid the visualization with all the output printed.
The description of the work done in task1 can be found in Documentation python - Anime dataset creation.docx.
The output of our work is an anime project.csv.

In the second part of the project, we analysed the dataset that we created in python, and it is possible to find the code with an explanation in Visualization_and_analysis.ipynb notebook.
Then we worked on the file covid.csv in R, and the code explanation is in the Task 2 in R - Covid-19 analysis.pdf file which was obtained by using a R markdown.
